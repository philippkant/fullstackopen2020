The Full stack open 2020 course by the **University of Helsinki** serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.

---

The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, and the use of MongoDB for storing the applicationâ€™s data.

This year's edition of the course contains a new part on TypeScript. Content for this part is provided by Terveystalo.

### Credits

The course is worth **3-9 credits**, and the content is the same as in the Full stack course held at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki in Spring 2020. There is also an associated project that is worth 1-10 credits. For **3 credits**, you must submit all compulsory exercises (without asterisks) **for parts 0-3**. For **5-7 credits** the number of credits and the grade are based on the total number of **submitted exercises for parts 0-7** (including exercises marked with an asterisk). **8-9 credits** can be achieved by submitting the exercises for **part 8 and 9**. Exercises in parts 8 and 9 do not count towards the grade for the 5-7 credit course.
